            <h2> Sports Cities </h2> 
            <p> Does a metropolitan area's economic vitality correlate with better performance on the court or field?  Do certain economic indicators, such as GDP or disposable income, correlate better with team performance?  Are some sports success more closely linkes to economic prosperity than others?  These questions stem from a common debate surrounding the net impact of having a professional sports team in a metropolitan area.  On the one hand, the presence of teams can draw tourism, create a thriving retail business, and boost locale morale. On the other hand, the presence of teams can drain taxpayer dollars that could have been allocated elsewhere.  <a href="https://stat231-01-f19.github.io/final-proj-CDC/"> Read more ... </a> </p>

          <h4> How has Amherst College Thinking Evolved over the Last 15 Years? </h4>
          <p> In this blog post, we leverage The Amherst Student as a source of understanding what major topics have been on the minds of students over the last 14 years.  We also compare the sentiment in The Amherst Student to the sentiment of Opinion articles.  We investiagte phenomena which we've accepted as Amherst students such as "the spring is always crazier", and understand shifts in the college after key administrative decisions such as financial aid policy changes, party policy, and demographic movements.   <a href=" https://stat231-01-f19.github.io/final-proj-groupC/"> Read more ... </a> </p>

             <h2> The Pursuit of Happiness </h2>
             <p> We have seen several development indicators including GDP, GDP per capita, life expectancy, and education rates that determine how "developed" a country is.  However, we wanted to figure out how (if at all) these indicators correspond to the overall happiness of the people.  Does greater economic prosperity correspond to greater happiness of the people?  <a href="https://stat231-01-f19.github.io/final-proj-JAN/"> Read more ... </a> <br />

            <h3> Climate Change in the Lens of Economic Freedom </h3>
            <p> Using economic freedom data from the Fraser Institute and CO2 emissions data from Gapminder.org, we explore what kinds of country characteristics give rise to better or worse CO2 emissions.  <a href="https://stat231-01-f19.github.io/final-proj-unconfident/"> Click here </a> for visualizations that make it easy for you to see links between various economic factors and CO2 emissions.  What policy changes to reduce CO2 emissions might this analysis suggest?  <br />

              <h4> The Geographical Evolution of College Football in the United States </h4>
              <p> We explore how the strength of college football programs by state has changed over time.  While college football began in the Northeast, the majority of successful Division 1 programs are now located in the South.  We construct a time-based heatmap displaying the spatial movement of college football from its infancy in 1869 to the present day.  <a href=" https://stat231-01-f19.github.io/final-proj-RMT/"> Check it out here . . .</a>

              <h4> Public Health and Foreign Aid Ties </h4>
              <p> We explore the association between countries' statistics associated with health quality and their reception of foreign aid from the US.  We investigate whether the US decides where its foreign aid goes based on humanitaran reasons, and whether the aid is efficacious.  We hypothesized that the US may base a significant part of its aid decisions on humanitarian reasons, but the rest may be based on national security concerns.  Looking at the outliers for the trend between humanitarian concerns and foreign aid may reveal those countries that the US deems critical to national security.  <a href="https://stat231-01-f19.github.io/final-proj-outters"> Read more ... </a> </p>
